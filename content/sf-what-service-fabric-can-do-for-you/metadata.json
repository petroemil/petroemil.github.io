  "Title": "Introduction to Service Fabric â€“ Part 2: What Service Fabric can do for you?",
  "Summary": "Service Fabric offers a wide range of tools to manage services and many of these can be used without touching an existing service, purely through manifest files. I believe walking through these is a good exercise because these are typically the kind of features people try to achieve for their own services, hosted on-premises or even in the cloud.",
